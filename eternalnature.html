Rock and roll has never had definition. Its character has never been bound to one classification of music. Unlike other genres, what defines “rock and roll” is its truly boundless nature; one of which has been altered and shifted countless times over the past 70 years. So, if one was to listen to today’s music, could any and every song that they listen to be defined as rock? In many ways, yes. But realistically, no. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;There are certain songs, artists, and genres that follow in the footsteps of what rock and roll was originally meant to be. Music that reflects the pioneering and barrier-breaking spirit that rock was originally built upon. To understand this thesis, we will explore two different songs produced within the past decade that exemplify the modern definition of rock music. These songs will be ‘BABYLON’ by Joey Bada$$ and ’12.38’ by Childish Gambino, 21 Savage, Ink, and Kadhja Bonet. Each song finds a way to push the boundaries of modern music either lyrically or musically, epitomizing the bona fide purpose of rock and roll. So, let’s do a deep dive into each song and determine exactly why I see them as perfect examples of contemporary rock and roll. 
                     <br/>

&emsp;&emsp;Ever since Joey Bada$$ was selected as one of the XXL Freshman of the Year back in 2013, he has continued to grow his sound as an artist and his voice as an activist. His efforts to push the boundaries of not only his sound, but more importantly his lyricism have turned him into one of the most socially aware artists in the game right now.

&emsp;&emsp;Being aware of the issues that plague the lives of your compatriots and using your platform to address them is one of the main pillars that rock and roll was originally built upon. Artists like Queen, Prince, and The Beatles were incredibly adept at this, inspiring entire generations to seek change in a world that didn’t necessarily want to change for them. 
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Joey’s 2017 album, “All-Amerikkkan Bada$$” follows in these footsteps, diving into the rampant problem of police brutality in America, an issue that hadn’t be readily addressed by many artists of his time. 
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;On the 3rd-to-last song on the album, ‘BABYLON’ he speaks to how America, but specifically the police system, doesn’t love his kind anymore. In fact, they never have. In a painful plea to the American people he says, “If black lives really mattered you n****s would do something, instead we mean nothing, in fact we being hunted, they don’t want us in abundance, they know its strength in them numbers… if you ain’t got a gun then you better start running.” This line and the song itself are an allusion to bible verse 51:6 where Jeremiah says, “Run away from Babylon and save your lives! Don’t stay and be killed because of Babylon’s sins.”

                    <br/>
Joey uses the ancient city of Babylon as a proxy to how present-day America treats its black population. The sins of America are far beyond the black community’s control, and without substantial change being made, Joey calls for an exodus away from this cursed “city of Babylon,” otherwise known as, the United States of America. 
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;This use of scripture to explain the struggles that black America was facing at the time of the song’s release (2017) shows Joey’s immense connection to a part of rock and roll’s original purpose. To push the boundaries of your music and incite change through one’s lyricism. This goal came to fruition in a 2017 Rolling Stone interview where Joey said, “There comes a point in a musician’s life, especially when the country is undergoing a lot of shit, where you start to feel like you need to speak up.” As one of the most societally conscious, issue-aware, and lyrically talented rappers of my generation, Joey Bada$$ is the living, breathing definition of a modern-day rock and roll artist. 
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;An alternative way to look at how rock and roll has continued to live on in hip-hop culture is through Childish Gambino’s 2020 album ‘3.15.20.’ Ever since Childish Gambino (real name Donald Glover Jr.) came onto the rap scene back in 2012, he has continued to push the boundaries of what we thought we knew as “music.” Akin to 60’s and 70’s artists like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, and Led Zeppelin, his experimentation with a variation of sounds and beats evolved his sound into something that people hadn’t really heard before.
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;We see this on his song ‘12.38’ with 21 Savage, Ink, and Kadhja Bonet, where he goes on a psychedelic trip with Psilocybin and uses his music to detail the various stages of the trip. What could be separated into three different songs, gets mashed into one cluster of sounds, adding to the psychedelic effect of an everchanging sonic environment. What initially starts out as a laid-back R&B beat turns into pure electronic chaos at around 2/3’s of the way through the song. The track then lulls back into the original R&B beat for 21 Savage’s verse. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                   <center><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/011ZwIM48eD8ee2UBpG8nK" width="250" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></center>
                    <Center><b>"12.38" via Spotify</b></Center>
                    <br/>
To reach the climax of the song, and inherently the trip, Gambino chooses to mash up all parts of the track back into one for the last minute of the song. With the original R&B beat keeping the pace, the electronic sounds maintaining the chaos, and a variety of distorted voices only adding to the mayhem, it is so imperfectly perfect; flawlessly flawed, that it just works.
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;It’s songs like these that affirm for me that rock and roll is still alive and well in today’s musical rotation. By pushing us outside of what we see as normally comfortable for our ears, Gambino is doing what so many rock and roll artists did before him. Experimenting with sound until it is uniquely his own. 
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Joey Bada$$ pushed the boundaries of music through his lyricism, Childish Gambino did it through his musicianship. Without artists like them, the change-bearing spirit of rock and roll would not live on into today’s music marketplace. Much of our music nowadays follows a certain lyrical and musical formula that is built to get the artist plays, streams, and consequently money. What it really takes is individuals like Joey and Gambino to push past this “formula” and use their platform to incite real change. Whether that be through their words or through their music, the art that they’ve made falls directly in line with rock and roll’s true mission. Music that pushes us outside of our comfort zone and expands the boundaries of what we’ve thought we’ve always known as “music.”
