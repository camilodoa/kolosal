            <p5><span style="background-color: white"> &emsp;&emsp;British rapper Tinie Tempah's 2010-11 debut studio album 'Disc-Overy' was one of the more influential albums of my youth. Earlier this month, I posted a Twitter thread on this very subject, and this article will be more or less the same. You can find this thread here: <a href="https://twitter.com/KolosalMusic/status/1314239870878048256"></a> 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;First off, let's get something straight, this album is a certified DOUBLE platinum classic, and I will always love it. That being said, a good few of the tracks are a victim of late 2000's // early 2010's pop sound, which, let's face it, didn't stay around for too long. That's not to say that those hits from that era don't bang now, but it means that those tracks intended to be potential hits that didn't make it fall that much harder. 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;For example, take the legendary producer Timbaland's second studio album, 'Shock Value', released in 2009, within two years of Tinie's debut project. You have the songs that suceeded, "If We Ever Meet Again" ft. Katy Perry, "Carry Out" ft. Justin Timberlake (definitely my favorite), "Morning After Dark" ft. Nelly Furtado & SoShy, and "Say Something" ft. Drake. Without analyzing the longevity of these tracks, there are NINE other tracks on the project. Songs such as "We Belong To The Music" ft. Miley Cyrus, the 6-minute "Ease Off The Liquor", and "Can You Feel It" ft. Esthero & Sebastian.. tough listens now. So yeah, lots of the tracks on 'Disc-Overy' also fall victim to this strange sound of the late 2000's // early 2010's, but that is the case for (most likely) all pop-sounding albums released in this period. So with that being said, let's move onto the review. 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;This is a review for the American deluxe version of 'Disc-Overy', and we will be breaking down and scoring each track individually. 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                1. <b>"Intro"</b> 
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;‘Disc-Overy’ is largely about Tinie trying to cope with his newfound fame, and it is evident here. Musically, this is a hot & Cold track, the robot vocals don’t really hold up a decade later, but it is a great introduction to the album. 
                SCORE: 5.5/10 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                2. <b>"Simply Unstoppable"</b>
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;"I’m about to clean up like a Dyson/ ‘Cause I just say it how it is like Simon/ I like the taste of alcohol I got wine gums"
                Hard-hitting, banging tune 
                Great chorus to couple Tinie’s spitting. 
                SCORE: 8.5/10
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                3. <b>“Pass Out”</b>
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;The first single off the album, released in Feb. 2010 and #1 hit in the UK. ALL-TIMER. Tinie rides the beat like nobody’s business, and this song is seldom skipped. 
                “Where’s my fucking clap? / Where’s my encore?” 
                SCORE: 9.5/10 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;Forgot to mention that the legend Labrinth is on the track. Philly’s own ChiddyBang got on a remix of the song. They were momentarily signed to parlophone along with Tinie. It was released on their 2010 tape ‘Air Swell’
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                4. <b>“Till I’m Gone”</b> ft. Wiz Khalifa
                <br/>
                <center><img src=tillimgone.png height=200px></center>
                &emsp;&emsp;Great cross-Atlantic collab. This track was released as the first single of the deluxe version of the album, released May 2011. The sound is a little dated, but still a solid listen.
                SCORE: 7.5/10 
                The song even made it onto one of the best TV Series of all time, 'Breaking Bad', Season 4 Episode 6: “Cornered” 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                5. <b>“Illusion”</b> 
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Once again, the robot vocals may sound a bit dated, but Tinie’s performance is so smooth. This song definitely further highlights his struggle with fame. “Leave your baggage at the stairs and your worries at the door” 
                SCORE: 7/10 
                
<br/>
                 <br/>
                
                6. <b>“So Addicted”</b> ft Bei Maejor
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Once again a decade old rap/pop album is going to be susceptible to a slightly dated sound, and this song is a victim of that. Not sold on the hook despite Bei’s performance, and Tinie’s lyrics are not up to standard here. 
                SCORE: 6.5/10
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                7. <b>“Snap” </b>
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;One of my favorite songs of all-time. Funky beat, combined with peak lyrics describing an intricate story of Tinie’s life before fame 
                “Second year of college on the fourth day ..” 
                SCORE: 10/10
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                8. <b>“Written in the Stars”</b> ft. Eric Turner
                <br/>
                <center><img src=written%20in%20the%20stars.png height=150px></center>
                &emsp;&emsp;The 3rd single from the album released in Sep. 2010 truly made Tinie a worldwide sensation. While it’s been overplayed to the point of an almost immediate skip, you can’t not rate the hook.
                SCORE: 5.5/10 

                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                9. <b>“Frisky”</b> ft. Labrinth
                <br/>
                <center><img src=frisky.png height=150px></center>
                &emsp;&emsp;The 2nd single off the project released June 2010 is a banger for sure. The beat is a little dated but the dynamic duo still absolutely KILL IT. “Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?” 
                SCORE: 8/10
                “Frisky” also contains the only sample throughout the whole project, the very famous drum break from The Winston’s “Amen Brother”
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                10. <b>“Miami 2 Ibiza”</b> (Swedis House Mafia)
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Definitely more of an EDM feel, but oh boy what a classic, still slaps to this day. Tinie’s opening verse is top notch and then he brings it back for the second again.“I got a black BM / She got a white TT”
                SCORE: 8.5/10
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                11. <b>“Love Suicide”</b> ft. Ester Dean
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Once again this is a track that is a victim of a dated pop sound. Nonetheless a solid track and Tinie’s verses and delivery are up to par.“Love suicide is killing me / You’re getting into my head like a guillotine”
                SCORE: 5.5/10
                
                 <br/>
                <br/>
                
                12. <b>“Wonderman”</b> ft. Ellie Goulding 
                <br/>
                <center><img src=wonderman.jpg height=200px></center>
                &emsp;&emsp;This was my first ever Tinie song I listened to. This is another continuation of Tinie’s struggle with fame, and while there’s depth & the story is great, the music doesn’t really hold up. Extra .5 for video/nostalgia.  
                SCORE: 6/10 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                13. <b>“Let Go”</b> ft Emeli Sandé
                <br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Yet another great glimpse into Tinie’s mind whilst he was struggling to cope with his newfound celebrity. Great vocals but definitely not a cemented sound, solid track. “Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room”
                SCORE: 6/10
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
             <center>  <b> AVERAGE//OVERALL SCORE: 7.23/10</b> </center>
<br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;One of our fav pop albums to listen back on. If this review was conducted 10 years ago, the score would be much higher. A lot of tracks sounds out of place as their sound didn’t stay around. Still an incredible listen</span>
