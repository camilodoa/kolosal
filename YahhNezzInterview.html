Bakersfield-born, but Southeast-DC-raised artist Chirstian Yañez, or known by his stage name Yahh.Nezz, is much more than just a rapper. <b>He’s a producer:</b> making, engineering, and mastering much of his own work from his OG tracks like ‘Petunia’ to his more recent work on ‘BOTANY VOLUME II’ as well. <b>He’s a brand:</b> creating his own clothing line named <b>“Digital Hustler”</b> which aims to be a brand that aligns exactly with his vision as an artist in this increasingly digitalized music industry. <b>He’s a stand-up brother:</b> from collaborating with some of his high school best friends on his projects to giving each and every producer on ‘BOTANY VOLUME II’ a feature-credit so they could get the recognition they have so long deserved. Most importantly however, <b>he’s the definition of a modern-day visionary:</b> from the struggles he’s had to overcome in his music career to his incredible perspective on life and the motivation it takes to start working for YOU. He’s everything and more that we could’ve asked for in an interview and we couldn’t be more excited to share his story with you. 
                    <br/>

Now there’s no way that the whole 45-minute interview would fit into one cohesive article, but to give you a glimpse I’ll be splitting the article up into 4 different sections, each addressing a different pillar of Yahh.Nezz’s story. The questions I chose are not in sequential order, but rather in an order that tells his story best. You can watch the full interview on our YouTube channel <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmvLD4VvaI&t=1847s>(@Kolosal Music)</a>or listen to the entirety of the Kolosal Podcast on our <a href=spotify:episode:0DPkeQsghfYy9XESAnjuxX>Spotify (@Kolosal Music Group)</a> or <a href=https://soundcloud.com/kolosalmusicgroup/kolosal-podcast-3-yahhnezz-special-guest> SoundCloud (@Kolosal) </a> to get the full picture. Let’s get into the interview. 
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

<center><h1><b>“My Biggest Competitor is Me”:</b></h1></center>
<br/>
                
                    <br/>
<b>ND: Your art is incredible, and we definitely wanted to highlight that. And going off of that, you mentioned earlier that a year ago you were saying ‘I didn’t want to put out my music, I was a little timid.’ We saw at the beginning of the ‘Passiflora (Make it Work)’ video that you said, ‘My biggest competitor is me’, and you also said that on SoundCloud in ‘M.O.E. (My Own Enemy)’. I just wanted to know: what made you take that step to say, ‘I don’t really mind what other people think, this is my art, I want to do what I want to do, and if they don’t like it, screw them, this is the art that I’m putting out, it’s for me’?</b>
                    <br/>
 <br/>
                   
‘My Own Enemy’, to be real frank with you, I want to give you guys a quick shoutout and accolade because, I put out that song ‘M.O.E.’ with no push, I posted it one time, put the link up, and I was like ‘if my people, my real people who really fuck with the music, this is for y’all’ and that was the first and last time I put it out. Shoutout to you guys for doing your research. 
 <br/>

                    <br/>
                    
Yeah, I made it a point to make that song because, you know how it is man, your brain, your doubt, your insecurities, all that, meshed in and intertwined, it holds you back and if you let those voices get too loud, it will be freaking halt your process, your progress, everything. And when I flipped the switch to be like bro, I can’t just be sitting here cooking up these beats, and like ‘are they good enough?’ you know, being timid, I want to push it, I’ll post a couple but then I won’t go further than that. And it’s like, if I don’t fight for myself to put myself on as hard as I can, nobody else will. Nobody else will. Even my best friend, my family, my mom, nobody. It’s just me, you know what I mean?
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>ND: Those are wise words, you’re a true visionary.</b>
 <br/>
                     <br/>
                     
Thank you bro. It’s been a long journey of learning, you know? I think the thing that’s helped me move further is to acknowledge that you guys come first, like everybody. We’re all equal playing parts of the freaking game, and everybody deserves their recognition. Coming from the producer side, I’m aware of that. You know what I mean? I know how hard it is for Kolosal Music Group to fucking get exposure. I know how hard it is for Yahh.Nezz to get his fucking music heard. But being real, I put my music out and I’m like, you expect like a million views and streams off the rip, but nobody gives a shit, you know what I mean? Nobody’s listening, nobody gives a fuck. You have to MAKE them listen, and that’s what I’m trying to do. I like to do these visuals to try to talk less, but to just show, you know what I mean? Like the proof is in the pudding. So, I’m really really freaking like just ecstatic about that, you know? And I made it a point, like all those features you mentioned earlier Sean, all the features on the project, are specifically for producers. There’s not a single rapper on my project. I made it a point to shoutout everybody as if they were the artist because they are. It’s 50/50. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>SC: That’s so real.</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
                     
As the rapper, I ain’t shit without those beats, those beats ain’t shit without this rapper. I’m just trying to highlight that man, I really am. I’m trying to do it the right way, so everybody gets credit, and all of us get paid. You know? All of us.
<br/>
                    <br/>
                     <br/>
<b>SC: You know I feel like that perspective only comes from someone who’s seen, you know, both sides of the game; being a producer and a rapper, you get to see that that recognition is so important and now that you’re in a position where you can actually give these guys the recognition they deserve, that’s so real man. Like the fact that you’re giving these guys those props? Love that, love that.</b> 
<br/>
                     <br/>
                     
Thanks man, thank you. Everybody, Even my homies who do the behind the scenes camera work, everybody gets a shoutout. 
<br/>
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>ND: What was your favorite part of your career?</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
                     
‘DAHLIA PINATA.’ I finished making that song and it was something about the way the like the hymns and the hums and the, like the wave of the song that just made me start crying. Like I was just bawling in the studio because it was the first time, you guys where I felt like I finally achieved a sound that I was proud of.
<br/>
                    <br/>
Oh my God. I was so hard on myself and that's why I think I got so emotional because I, I was just hard on myself and always told my, my brain was always saying not good enough. My brain is saying, this is fucked up. This is not perfect. And I, I played that shit back after I recorded it and I started weeping man.
<br/>
                    <br/>
For that, for that reason, it just, it just sticks with me. Dahlia is like the state, the national flower for Mexico, and the piñata was a play on the line where I was like talking about being the Mexican Sinatra. I finally like starting to mix in the singing and given the reference to Usher in the beginning, you know, he did the song called ‘My Way.’ Frank Sinatra was known for a song called ‘My Way.’ And now Christian is known for a song doing it <b>my way.</b> So that's, that was the track, the connection right there. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <center><img src="Dahlia.jpg" height=130px> </center>
                    <center>Dahlia Flower</center>
                     <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>ND: That's beautiful. Yeah. And you broke through that wall that, you know, that you said was you holding yourself back, like you finally just destroyed it and realized that ‘I have attained the sound and this is how, how far I've come’.</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
                    
Journey is a journey. That's what I like, and now that I'm starting to experience these things, I don't want to, I want to keep that shit to myself, you know, like. I've always been a sharer just through culture and being Mexican. Like I always offer, give, give, give, give, give.
<br/>
                    <br/>
And I just can't, now that I'm seeing it with my own eyes and experiencing the journey, that's why I'm so adamant about sending all the information that I can to anybody who's working. Because I know I’m an artist, I know how hard it is. And then any little piece that I can help, like I don't, I can't sit with this by myself, man.
<br/>
                    <br/>
That's greedy. You know what I mean? Like, I, I just want to just help because I know that the world will help me if you keep that fucking vibe going man. 
<br/>
                    <br/>

<center><h1><b>Who’s Hungry? – Surround Yourself w/ the Likeminded People:</b></h1></center>
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
<b>SC: Yeah, so are most of the people that you work with your close friends? Like within your close friend group? </b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
Yeah so, the people, like my homie Kyrie (<b>@TheRealFlyKai</b> on Instagram) we went to High School together, he’s been the homie since. My camera man AKA My Shoota, Aaron (<b>@SouthernSoundsFilms</b> on YouTube and Instagram) we met through one of my neighbors, who actually, we’re like family you know what I mean? To be real. And she introduced me to him because they’re dating. And they said, ‘hey he does film work, you do music, let’s see what happens’ and he has such an amazing story. He’s been like filming for Fat Trel, another D.C. artist, he used to film a lot of his music videos back in the day when he first started. 
        <br/>
                    <br/>
He just told me the other day, he’s like ‘I did this this’ (referencing music video for Fat Trel), ‘next thing I knew I was on tour with Juicy J’ and I was like what the fuck? I was like who are you? You know what I mean? And it’s the little shit like that that makes you pay attention and pay attention to the signs. I always found myself trying to, you know, find something else to like make it work. And then I finally started giving back to people, helping out other artists, helping out other producers, and asking you know? I was like ‘man I really want a videographer’ because I can’t in-house that part, you know what I mean? Like I’m just not there yet. And it just all fell into place, and I’m thankful for that. 
                    <br/>

                     <br/>
<b>ND: We want to become the next big outlet. To really prop up musicians, any sort of art. We want to be able to prop up people such as yourself from DC and anybody that we think their vision aligns with ours. Same set of values. And we're not just limited to music, but you know, that's what we're focused on right now because you know, we only have limited manpower. You know, we have, you know, 150 followers on Instagram.</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
Hey, that's 150 more than the person that's sitting on their ass at home wishing that they could do something like this. I always like the one thing, like, look at me, I have my music in my head.
<br/>
                    <br/>
I'm like, aw, dude, I'm fucking out of here, but you know, that's 659 followers, but I'm so appreciative for those. So like I was, I was where you guys were, you know, and to hear you say, talk about that, right? Like your friends and you're putting together, the group, you know, as a unit. It's hard to get everybody coordinated.
<br/>
                    <br/>
You start realizing that people may not be as hungry as you, or they're not as invested in your business, right? You guys see the shining glimmering light, right? And then, you know what I'm talking about? Like, ah, dude, this idea's too fucking good to not push it. And then you realize you're like, people just aren't as motivated as you.
<br/>
                    <br/>
And it hurts because like you're saying, right, you're saying like, there's probably 8 friends. Those are your homies. And then you're like, damn man. Alright, why aren't you motivated like me? 
<br/>
                    <br/>
It’s reality, It’s life, I'm dealing with it. I'm learning myself right now. Like I was like, damn, this whole time, I was like, y'all we’re bullshitting. And you know, I smoke weed now, I haven't drank in almost a year, but you know, back when I did. You're like chilling and socializing and drinking, and then you're like, ah, now this is the dream this is the goal. And then the next day you're like, hold up, why is it only me and Sean here? Where the fuck is everybody? You know what I mean? Like, and I know you didn't ask for this, but, I would just say on that, because it's so important, don't let that stop you alright. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
Don't let it, like if they can't make it cool. No worries, bro. I'm going to make my shit shine until you want to come latch on. And by that time you already found the people who noticed your buzz and they'll be like, nah, I want to work. Like, I'll do it for free. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
You know what I mean? Like, I'm telling you this, just focus, just focus on putting in the work, even if it's just like the, both of you, like go hard, go as hard as you can. Don't worry about them. Like at the end of the day, you just gotta keep pushing towards the vision and then if you want that shit bad, go man, go, don't worry about it.
<br/>
                    <br/>
Don't worry about it. Don't take it personal either. Don't like, I used to take it personal cause I was like, but you know, some people just aren't ready to make the shift and the change yet and you guys are, and I can, I can smell it like on, through the interview. You know what I mean? Like I recognize that.
<br/>
                    <br/>
                     <br/>

<center><h1><b>Future Goals:</b></h1></center>
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
<b>SC: So I want to ask you sort of what's the, what's the vision for the next sort of year or two? Like what would you put out? What are you hoping to be as an artist, as an individual? Like what's the goal? </b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
The ultimate goal is to become a philanthropist for the community.
<br/>
                    <br/>
I am very, very ultimate goal is to go back to my hometown in Bakersfield, California, and in Southeast Washington, DC to really, really just put in like resources and affordable like representation, legal representation, affordable anything that seems out of reach. I want to help out my community with that starting in my hometown and where I grew up in Southeast DC.
<br/>
                    <br/>
That’s the ultimate goal. So, my music has always been my hobby and you know how it goes, right? It's like you, you start off and you're like kind of shy of telling people, but like, ‘I don't really take it that serious’, but you know, I was like, man, I wanted to get to that point. And in order to do that, I gotta be heard, you know what I mean?
<br/>
                    <br/>
And I hate jumping out and doing this, like in front of the camera, whether you believe it or not, I don't like doing this. You know what I mean? Like I wanna just make the music and put it out, but reality, you know, realistically you gotta put out everything as a whole aligned unit, package, product. So, yeah.
<br/>
                    <br/>
Well, I'm learning as I go, but shoot, something's happening. If you guys are hitting me up to do an interview, man, I'm doing something right?
<br/>
                  
                    <br/>
                     <br/>

<center><h1><b>Botany – The Meaning Behind the Art:</b></h1></center>
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
<b>ND: And going back to, to botany, both projects. How do you choose the plants for each track name? Do you own any of the plants or do have you have any of the plants or it's just, you know, like how they look.</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
I like that question, man. Shoot dude. It's like, part of it was the name of the song by each flower, in order for the listeners to have zero expectations. Absolutely zero. Right. Because when you're reading down and you're like, okay, there’s song called like, ‘Yeah Yeah’, and a song called ‘Back That Ass Up’, and a song called ‘Just Living’, you know what I mean? It’s almost like you kind of just, not to be vulgar, but you throw your nuts out on the table and it's like, ‘All right, here's my dick. Like everybody look at it!’. But there's no foreplay. You know what I mean? It's like, there's no lead-up. There's no, no letting your mind do the imagination. Like when you see beautiful women in life or on Instagram it’s like, to me, the most attractive shit is when a woman like, has like just a classy look.
<br/>
        <br/>
That you can tell she's not revealing too much, but it makes your like brain, start to imagine. You know what I mean? So I want it to evoke that same exact feeling with every name of the song, every flower, how I picked it, I listened to each song and sometimes naturally the content comes before the name that ‘AGAVE’ record, right, I made, I made that record a year and a half ago before I had any idea of coming up with the name ‘Botany.’ And here we go, it's a plant. You know what I mean? I'm like, holy shit, I've been piecing this together little by little. ‘Petunia’ same thing. I made that record before I even thought about the album concept ‘Botany’ like ‘Don't step on my petunias’. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
You know what I mean? It's like, it's just weird alignment and, for the other songs that don't kind of reference the flower name I talk about, I picked the flower based on the mood. It's not that right. So like for instance, ‘MAUVE CARNATION’, right? It's like a lo-fi beat, kind of sexy song. And I was like, man, this is a really risqué kind of concept, especially talking about this shit, you know, and having my wife listen to it, I'm like, you know, this is my art and I just have to be real.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <center><img src=carnation.png height=160px></center>
                    <center>A Mauve Carnation Flower</center>
                    <br/>
                    
Cause I've been in situations, even with you, where were talking about my wife, it's like, you know, you're leading up, you're, you know, you're warming up the honeypot and then you fuck around and say the stupidest shit, and then the mood is done. You know what I mean? And you’re like FUCK, FUCK.
<br/>
                    <br/>
And I can't tell you how many dreams I've had like that and I'm like, ah, damn it. But you know, that vibe creates that like alignment with the flower name ‘MAUVE CARNATION’ is the flower that represents, you know, sexy time, you know what I mean? So that's why I picked that name.
<br/>
                    <br/>
And then the ‘CEMPASUCHIL’, that's like the orange flower that's known in Mexico for Dis de los Muertos, so it’s like in the movie, ‘Coco’ with the bright luminescent orange flowers. And then on top of that for my album cover. And then on top of that with the seasons. I started, I'm starting to see that each flower color project is all coordinated with the seasons.
<br/>

You know what I mean? Bright, dark, fall, winter, spring. It's like, the more I keep throwing spaghetti noodles on the wall, the more I'm like, ‘Oh shit, this is making more and more sense’. So, I wish that I could take credit to say, ‘Oh, I have this immaculate plan’, but the more I'm like, just fucking up and trying, it's just falling into place. And I'm thankful for that. So thankful for that. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
                     <br/>
<b>SC: That’s such a cool concept bro. Like, you know, when you look at it, you know, it just looks like a bunch of plants and flowers, but that's why I appreciate, you know, reaching out to artists and actually getting the chance to talk to you guys. It's like, there was so much more story and reason behind people's art that you just don't get the chance to know about it, unless you actually get the chance to talk to ‘em. </b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
<b>ND: I thought that it was really cool that you kind of said, you take this as art. Don't take it as, you know, you don't have any pre-depositions to think about what the song would sound like from the title. You just said, this is art, listen to it and make your own opinion.</b>
<br/>
                     <br/>
Facts man. And once you get to learn the song, you know, you create that other connection with it. And now it's like, you have a flower to like connect with that. And it's interesting because I heard a saying that ties into Dia de los Muertos and like the death and this time of year, the history behind it. It's Mexican history and I love the connection because it's like somebody once said, <b>I want to give you your flowers while you can still receive them.</b> 
<br/>
                    <br/>
You know what I mean? Cause the one time that you, even as males, that you receive flowers is when you fucking die, like what the fuck! Where was my recognition and all of this love, amazing shit you have to say about me when I was alive! When I'm alive or where's that love at? You know? And that's, this is what I wanted to do.
<br/>
                    <br/>
So to my fans and my listeners to everybody, like, I want to give you your flowers while you can still receive them. So each song, whatever you gravitate towards, or if you don't eventually down the line, if you do. That's your flower, you know what I mean? And that's yours.
