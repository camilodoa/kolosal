Music finds its inspiration from anywhere and everywhere. Whether it’s found through the foundation of a genre or artist that came before you or in the hymns of a sacred religious text, there is always a story behind the music. The use of someone else’s work as inspiration for your own is called “referencing.” The term has no concrete definition; there’s no line drawn of where referencing starts and where it ends, but this is the beauty of it. When making music, the artist/producer/composer can take a variety of aspects from previous works to inspire their own. Whether it be through music, art, film, poetry, anything, the use of referencing has been everlastingly prevalent. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;To show this we’re going to explore two different songs, one from rock’s formative period (1955-65) and one from my current listening today to understand how the artists and their respective songs utilized reference to enhance their art. We’ll begin with R&B classic, <i>At Last</i> by Etta James and end with the recently released <i>Ea’alah</i> by rap collective Spillage Village. Through looking into the influences behind the sound, lyrics, and meaning of each song, we’ll be able to gain a better perspective on how the art was cultivated by the artists in the first place.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The late great Etta James and her song <i>At Last</i> have stood the test of time as a staple in the R&B world. Originally written by composers Mack Gordon and Harry Warren in 1941, the song was never meant to be the blues ballad that it later became. It was written specifically for a couple of film musicals performed by Glenn Miller and his accompanying orchestra (SongFacts, 2020). This version of the song had the exact same lyrics as James’ rendition, but was composed quite differently. 
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;In the original version, Glenn Miller’s voice is accompanied by a brass band. One can hear the variation of trumpets and trombones in the background, along with a steady drum bass guitar beat to supplement the horns. This was a commonly referenced arrangement at the time, especially in cities like New York City where producer Harry Warren was from (Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, 2020).
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Etta James’ 1961 rendition of the song, however, took on a different form than the original. Produced by Polish brothers, Leonard and Phil Chess of Chess Records (who James had just signed to at the time), their version of <i>At Last</i> needed to follow the current trends of music of the times. It needed to be updated to a sound that would not only satisfy the ears of its listeners, but also the hearts and minds. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;At the time of its release in 1961, the Civil Rights Movement was at its peak. With James being a black woman, she wanted to create a rendition of the song that was representative of her black culture. The Chess brothers were up for the challenge. Growing up in the Southside of Chicago as jazz nightclub owners, they had their fair share of black musical influence. After their financial success in the nightclub business, they acquired a local Chicago record company named Aristocrat Records and changed the name to Chess Records. Recording with predominantly black blues artists like Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters, and Chuck Berry, Chess Records took off as a staple in the industry for black music (Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, 2020). Etta James fell in love with the prospect of working with their label, so she signed a deal, and the legend of <i>At Last</i> began.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Both James and the Chess brothers took much of their inspiration from blues, doo-wop, and other predominantly black music. But the Chess brothers knew that if they wanted this rendition to reach the biggest audience possible, it would have to appeal to a new generation of pop music listeners (SongFacts, 2020). They saw the potential for James to crossover from blues to pop quite easily, so they were just as excited to work with her as she was to work with them.

                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;You can hear this change from blues to pop quite clearly. Instead of keeping the brass band to back James in the song, they chose to replace it with violins. Violins and orchestral music in general were very popular in Poland during the Chess brothers’ childhood. This ended up inspiring much of the music that they put out at Chess Records, including <i>At Last</i> (Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, 2020). This reference gave the song a dramatic yet relieving feeling that much of America needed in the time of the Civil Rights Movement. The lyrics didn’t change at all from one version of the song to another, but the meaning changed dramatically. What was once known as a song to replicate the feeling of seeing a long-lost lover once again, turned into a song that represented the exhaustion of black America in their fight for equality. The song was very well received by the public, reaching the #2 spot on the Billboard Top-100 in 1961 (Billboard, 2020). 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Fast forward to 60 years later and the fight for black rights and equality in America is still raging onwards. Blacks are still being killed at a disproportionate rate and are being oppressed in almost every aspect of the word. In response to this, black creatives from around the country have begun to use their platforms to inspire the change in the country once again. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;One example of this comes from black music collective, Spillage Village. Consisting of multiple artists including J.I.D, Earthgang, and 6LACK, their most recent album, Spilligon, speaks on some of the struggles that black Americans are going through in today’s day and age. Their song <i>Ea’Alah</i> acts as a prayer song; a prayer for their family, for peace, and for love in this very cruel world that we live in. Being a song about prayer, much of the lyrics reference the bible and Christianity. One of the best lines from the song comes from, Johnny Venus, who says “I aint perfect, go ask Satan, sometimes angels do the sinnin’.” This references the point in the holy bible where Satan became so obsessed with his own superiority as an angel that he believed he himself could challenge god (Genius, 2020). Satan chose to wage war against heaven, but was unsuccessful, leading to his perpetual banishment to hell. Venus is trying to say that despite being an “angel” or a good person in many people’s eyes, he still makes his fair share of mistakes in life that make him more of a demon than anything else.

&emsp;&emsp;The other part of this song that deserves recognition, is its production. Produced and mixed by Kendrick Lamar’s in-house DJ, MixedbyAli, there is a lot of referencing being done in this song. One of Kendrick’s and Ali’s biggest inspirations was Prince. His influence, power, and uniqueness as a black artist during a time when white music dominated the airwaves, was one of the main things that Kendrick and Ali cited about him (Jr, K., 2019). You can hear Prince’s inspiration in much of Ali’s work, including <i>Ea’Alah</i>. Backing the vocals of Spillage Village on <i>Ea’Alah</i>, you can hear a collection of guitars. One is playing a consistent heaven-esque melody throughout the whole song, but at about one minute in, a guitar solo comes in that is clearly reminiscent of Prince’s solos on songs like <i>Purple Rain</i> and <i>Kiss</i>. 
Ali also looked up to the legendary Dr. Dre for inspiration. His ability to control the tempo, timbre, and vibe of a song so fluidly not only inspired Ali, but also directly influenced his ensuing work (Jr, K., 2019). In <i>Ea’Alah</i> you can hear a steady drumline throughout the entire song that helps to keep it at a steady pace. This may seem like a small inclusion, but it is so integral to the track’s consistency that without it, the song wouldn’t be the same.

&emsp;&emsp;By referencing the music and work of people he looked up to, Ali was able to capture some of Prince and Dr. Dre’s magic that inspired him from the very start, while still finding time to put his own twist on the work as well. This combination of past and modern works is exactly what makes <i>Ea’Alah</i> and <i>At Last</i> so good. Both producers were able to reference some of the works that inspired them to start making music in the first place. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The Chess Brothers touched into their Polish and Chicagoan backgrounds by fusing classical Polish violin with smooth Chicago blues. While MixedbyAli went to two of his childhood idols for inspiration by tapping into Prince’s guitar expertise and Dre’s prowess on the drumline. The artists themselves also utilized reference in their part of the production process. Etta James didn’t change the lyrics at all, but what she did change was the collective meaning of <i>At Last</i> to more fairly represent what was happening to her people and culture at the time. Similarly, Spillage Village references the bible multiple times in <i>Ea’Alah</i> to pray for the safety of their family. These prayers for safety are not only directed towards their loved ones, but also towards the “family” of black America as a whole. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The references towards the continued struggles of African Americans from both James and Spillage Village goes to show that reference not only plays a part in the musical aspect of songs, but also their societal impact as well. By tapping into some of the inspirations of their past, musical or not, they were able create timeless pieces of art that are completely unique to their character. Music is beautiful in that there are bounds to its creative process, but tactics like referencing are so integral to its production that without it, music could never be what it is today.
