            <p5><span style="background-color: white"> &emsp;&emsp;Since our theme for today is Metronomy Monday, I thought that it would be a good idea to do a quick informational article on the English electronic-rock group. 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;I got my first exposure to Metronomy in 2011, when I was able to download their single “The Bay” for FREE from iTunes. That just goes to show you how far the digital music-listening experience has come in just 9 years. “The Bay” comes from their 3rd studio album ‘The English Riviera’.

                <center>Devon, England</center>
                <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;The title of the album alludes to the roots of the band, as founder//frontman Joseph Mount hails from Devon in the Southwest of England. Mount started Metronomy in 1999 as a side project with one of his dad’s old computers. Mount linked up with bassist Gabriel Stebbing and his cousin Oscar Cash (saxophonist), and by the end of his time in University in Brighton, Metronomy was their main project.

                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;After University, Mount was a DJ for several spots in Brighton, where he got noticed by the founder of Holiphonic Records, who eventually released their debut studio album ‘Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe)’ in 2006. Later that year they signed to Because Music, who then released their 2008 sophomore album ‘Nights Out’, which included the single “Heartbreaker”, as well as their 2009 EP ‘Not Made for Love’.

                <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;Also in 2009, Stebbing left the band to focus on other projects, and in 2011 bassist Gbenga Adelekan and drummer Anna Prior joined the group. This was in time for the release of their most successful album ‘The English Riviera’. This project was much more fine-tuned than their previous work, and reached the #28 position on the U.K. charts. I definitely recommend checking this album out, especially “Everything Goes My Way”, “The Look”, “Corinne”, and “Love Underlined”.

                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;Their 4th album, 2014’s ‘Love Letters’ peaked at #7 on the U.K. charts, marking their most successful work yet. It was recorded in London at Toe Rag Studios, which is entirely analog. Bands such as the White Stripes and Tame Impala have recorded there in the past. Their 2016 album, ‘Summer 08’ was recorded in Paris, and boasts a feature from Swedish legend Robyn. ‘Metronomy Forever’, their latest album, was released in September of 2019, to generally lukewarm reviews. 
                
                <br/>
                 <br/>
                
                &emsp;&emsp;Metronomy is a very unique band well-worth checking out.
