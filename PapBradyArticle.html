Born-and-raised Southeast DC rapper, Pap Brady should undoubtedly be the next artist on your playlist. From timeless classics like ‘Amber Rose’ off his ‘Mr. Rogers’ mixtape, to newer hits like ‘Be Clear!’ featuring one of the Kolosal’s favorites, Yahh.Nezz, his versatility on the mic and creativity with the pen are unmatched by many in the DC-area right now. We thoroughly enjoyed interviewing him and we can’t wait to see what he has in store for 2021.

<b>Sean Carlson: So, what's up man? How was your New Year's? How were your Holidays? How have the past two weeks been treating you man?</b>
 <br/>
                    <br/>
             Great man, I've been chilling, I'm having a great week to be honest with you. Just been relaxing man. I'm just taking time to relax. I was really busy last year, just being able to reflect on a great year, it was a great feeling. So yeah, I'm rocking with the New year man. 2021 we going hard, you know? 
       <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                <b>SC: Yeah, love to hear it. Love to hear it. I mean ‘Go Hamma’ was crazy man we loved it. We been listening to it over and over again, it’s crazy to hear you on something new like that so that's good to hear. </b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
 Thank you man, I appreciate your checking that out. I'm gonna go ahead give y’all the exclusive though on ‘Go Hamma.’ Um, that tape was done like four years ago. But I didn't know I didn't really know like how to promo back in the day like I was just dropping music. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
 <b>SC: Oh word.</b>
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    So when I started to figure out like the business to like promoting in like streaming and all that stuff I was like I know it's a lot of people that haven't heard all these records and I'm listening to em and I'm like let me just re drop this just give them some more content to listen to 'cause I got so much of it. So to hear y’all response, it was so great so that's like I dropped in 2016 that was 2016 Pap Brady so. I think I added like two songs. I added two songs in there, one from like 2017-18, ‘Trust Me.’ And Donnie Simpson was like 2016 so I just record so much I'm like I gotta give them, you know my whole vault so. That's the old school. That's a four-year-old like tape. 
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>SC: Yeah, I noticed the video for ‘Trust Me’ was from two years ago so that makes a lot more sense. But nah for real you have been busy 2020 man. This is what your 4th project that you’ve come out with in 2020? I think it's ‘Addicts’, ‘Rowdy’, ‘From Southeast With Love’ and then ‘Go Hamma’ yeah. </b> 
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Yessir, yessir man, I’m blessed man. I was really blessed to be able to do exactly what I said, like literally, I said I was going to drop tapes this year. I do like yearly. I do like back and forth like I do a year all mixtapes and then a year all singles. So last year was like a mixtape year and like I say I thank God, I was just blessed man. I just got the reception that like y'all was loving it, you know everybody I was just getting a good response. And shoutout quarantine and all this Corona shit 'cause it boosted my shit you know what I mean. I know you see on Twitter everybody's like man fuck this year man. I mean I had a blessed year I was so blessed man like, and I just stayed focused, so you know obviously it's um, It paid off. You guys hit me up man, I appreciate that you know what I’m saying. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Noah Danz:
And we appreciate you coming on like majorly you're only our second guest and you know, Yahh.Nezz put us in contact with you. </b>
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                   We went to school together right, but he was a grade ahead of me. So, like I used to see him 'cause he was the only Hispanic dude in the school. Only Hispanic dude in our whole school. So, it's like you didn’t not know him, even if you didn't know him
                    <br/>
                <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>ND: Did you talk to him at all in high school? He kind of told us that you guys didn't.</b>  
 <br/>
                    <br/>
No, we didn’t talk at all like public, but OK so his boy, my boy is his boy like my boy Remy. So, me and Remy got cool because um, the first time like I got like like maybe almost kicked out of school was with him because he was recording me. He's used to always have a camera so over the years me and Remy, we shooting like little videos. He'll come from New Orleans, from college and come to southeast and just have his camera and just be with me. You know what I'm saying just have his camera on and so I guess in between time he was going to see Yahh.Nezz. So, I started rapping and getting into like I could, I didn't know he did music, but as soon as he followed me I was like oh, that's a Christian from Thurgood. And then it just came connected like that 'cause remember, my boy Remy was like you should work with him 'cause he been watching me rap for so long. He's like, yeah, work with him and then, I heard ‘Botany Volume 1’ you know, you know you gotta check people out. You know I was like let me check it out it was dope I was like yeah, that's work so I sent him some records but ‘From Southeast With Love’ I recorded it on my own on my iPod, I didn't go to the studio at all. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
 <b>SC: Really?!</b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                 Yeah, it was on garage band on my phone. I just mixed and edited it on my phone, so I sent him some records. So, we did a record, ‘Be Clear’ was like in the closet you know what I’m saying, I just put a towel on my head went in the closet. So, when I sent him the records, I sent him something like 3 records but they was really badly mixed except ‘Be Clear’. So that's how we ended up, I'm being like yeah, let me just come in your studio and we can just record you know what I'm saying, and I was like damn he's dope man. I think we really bring the best out of each other when we do a track together. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
 <b>ND: Absolutely yeah, that's crazy. That's a crazy. I would’ve never thought that you recorded ‘From Southeast With Love’ only on your iPhone, only on garage band. That's crazy. That takes some real talent Pap, that's like on your Steve Lacy shit.</b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
It took a while bro I appreciate it bro. It took a while. I learned how to mix back in the day, like I've been doing music for so long bro and I don't even know I was mixing back in the day like I'm just like figuring this stuff out, thank God. Like I feel like I always say I feel like God didn't allow me to like to reach or know certain things until certain moments 'cause I wasn't ready. You know what I'm saying, I wasn't ready man, everybody around my way I was recording, mixing, and mastering on a laptop and mixcraft I use mixcraft, I still do. That’s what I was doing, I’d record on garage band then send it to my email, send it to mixcraft, engineer on mixcraft and then ‘From Southeast With Love’ man I was like I was going I said imma engineer this whole thing. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
 <b>SC: That's so impressive, yo. I can't believe that. </b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>ND: That takes some real talent. </b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>Alex Gervais-Scott: That’s insane.</b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>SC: You got your own merch brand out right now yeah? Honorable Instinct? </b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Yessir Honorable Instinct you know what I'm saying, shoutout to Lex, Big Lex, that's you know what I’m saying that’s my girl, we put our minds together and we created honorable instinct you know what I'm saying. It's like a branch off, it's like kinda like merch a little bit, but it just turned into something different you know what I'm saying. Just my imagination is large, and it just turned into a difference, so you know what I'm saying shoutout to Honorable Instinct. And yeah, we basically a merch company and anything, everything that we make from what we get on the clothes, we give 10% to an organization or community organization in DC. We did for our first, we do seasons for the clothing, so our first season we donated back to DC housing. They help with affordable housing for DC and this season which is this right here *shows good looking hoodie* you know what I'm saying, I'm gonna hook y’all up man. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

Make sure y’all get some get some merch, you know, but we did it. We donated to the dreams, DC Dream Center and they help out around in my community. Actually, it's a uh, a Christian organization that they like actually built like a Recreation/Community Center like literally right by where I grew up and live. And I just started to see during the pandemic, they give out food on certain days. And I saw like at the beginning of the year, like you know, you see some people getting food, but you know, like how everything is going on with Corona like some people aren't as fortunate, especially in the Southeast area. ‘Round my way I just see the lines getting longer and longer. So, we just really working hard for the, uh, the Dream Center. Donating so far, we donate at least, I think, about almost $400 to them from what we've got.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>ND: Thank you!</b>  
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                  Yeah, no problem you know what I'm saying, God blessed me with so much man to be able to bless other people is just you know what you really should live for man. So, when everything is done with Corona I definitely want to be doing more like hands on stuff 'cause imma. Be real with y’all I ain't fucking with all that hanging out and all that stuff I've been in the house, that's probably why I learned how to do all the stuff ‘From Southeast With Love.’ Engineering, just being in the crib. So yeah, I'm trying to really just uplift the DC community you know what I'm saying, just get some ownership, especially for just being just African American at that you know what I'm saying. Like just actually investing in your community, even when, even when it may seem like the community is changing. As long as you investing in it and getting a part of it, you will always be a part of that community. And just letting people understand it's OK, you can do that. You know what I'm saying you don’t have to just invest your money to appreciate it, you know.

                    <center><h1> <b>Creative Goal for Music</b></h1> </center>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>ND: So just base level what is your mindset? What's your creative goal when you go into crew to produce and rap and do everything, mix as you said you did it all by yourself in garage band so what's your creative overall goal when you're going to create a project? </b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                   It's based on what I like, see around me and like what I’m into maybe at the time. Because I say rowdy, I started in 2018 like a cartoon when I was a Rowdyruff boy, like if you ever seen Powerpuff Girls, I came up on Cartoon Network. So, I made like, I got somebody to actually make a Rowdyruff version of me so that's why like the rowdy thing kind of started. And that word I was like I'm just used that word. Nobody ever uses that word so. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    You know, I try to just use my imagination. I don't know. It's just weird like I have a broad imagination and it's crazy like not to go on my mom, but she used to hate how I used to daydream but like that daydreaming is really what helped me like make music, really my music to spark. You know what I'm saying, if you really be around me a lot you hear so much stuff that you probably, I've done I've seen in my music, they're like, oh, that's from this time, so I just base it off my imagination or how I'm feeling, um. Feelings where I'm at feeling sometimes I just write words where I'm feeling at and just make the song break it down like that. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Um, I just tried to base it off where I'm at, man, just completely where I'm at, so you know, and I just always pray that my music touches people worldwide. And you know, when I look at like the analytics and stuff and I see like places like in Canada. I just linked up with a Australian producer like you know what I'm saying like. 
So that's how I know God is real and prayer is real, so you know, I just just let my imagination just go man. Rowdy was with the Rowdyruff Boys, ‘From Southeast With Love’ shoutout James Bond! I look up to James Bond so you know what I'm saying, he just so smooth I'm just like I'm like man I just wanna do something else. I'm just gonna add ‘From Southeast With Love’ 'cause I'm from Southeast. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Boom, ‘Go Hamma’, MC Hammer was my first favorite rapper ever. Uh the 1st song rap song like the rap rap song I ever heard, was ‘Hypnotize’ by Biggie and then um, we started getting, my parents was into music so they didn't. My mother was in in a choir and my dad just loved music so they just kept getting like tapes. They got these tapes like my and my first favorite soundtrack was the Space Jam album and I just like dig like that like Hip-Hop kind of stuff. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
And then we started seeing MC Hammer. I'm like this dude dope! I'm little I'm talking about like, I couldn't believe that he was dancing like this here, had dope rhymes you feel me. So that's what ‘Go Hamma’ came from and it's crazy when the mixtape first came out, MC Hammer actually ended up following me because I treated him was like “yeah like you inspired me for this tape.” So shoutout to MC Hammer my first favorite rapper man. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>AGS: You talk about daydreaming and how, how do you, what steps do you use now compared to when you started to take that imagination and to focus it in when you're writing your music, what steps do you use? How is that changed and evolved? How's your writing process changed and evolved when, from when you started? </b>
 <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I think I used to write more. Actually, I used to really wanna be like like like, lyrical. I wanted to give it the lyrics with my own little Southern style to it, you know. And then now I kinda like just see stuff and then I kinda just just kinda say a little line and then it just starts from there. To be honest, like I write sometimes, but most of the time it just be coming from just ideas like just saying stuff like I just finished Harry Potter you know what I'm saying, the whole series and now I got a song in the cut   
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>AGS: Please do please do. </b> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    And you know, just seeing her with the wand and all of a sudden I was listening to this other beat I was like “She keep a stick no Hermione Granger, whole lotta Webbers no power Ranger, car on my way I am not a strange …” like you know what I'm saying?  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
<b>SC: YO </b> 
 <br/> <br/>
                   And uh, and then I just kept everyday working on it in my head like on some Jay-Z shit and then I just went to Yahh.Nezz’s joint and we recorded it and he like, he like hearing everything like he's my new engineer I've been working with. Shoutout to 95 collective Ty, or at least almost three years, he engineered most of my music so I'm not gonna ever take that away from him, I think he's one of the best engineers in the city. But Yahh.Nezz, we have a personal connection to like the artist side so you know as an artist you know it's them tweaks that you know, so I’m doing records and he like, he turned around like “nah bro, these joints is hard” and I'm just kind of like just like you know I know it crank, you know what I’m saying, but I'm just like thanks like just hearing it man it's man, I can't even say my creativity just come just from everywhere, just what I see, what I hear.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
What somebody else says that I think is funny or interesting, you know what I’m saying. I done put some lines that somebody else done told me; that somebody else had said, and I was like “can I say that in a rhyme?” They be like yeah! 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

Um, my first mixtape, I got a track called ‘Amber Rose’ on my ‘Mr. Rogers’ mixtape. That was my first mixtape as Pap Brady. I used to just go by Pap; I used to only be Pap. You gotta really look up my old stuff just when I was just Pap like I wasn't Pap Brady yet. My cameraman gave me my name by accident. So, we’re like yeah, I used to work at Shake Shack, and I used to be on the grill, so like now it was like a long line down Dupont Circle. I don't know if y’all been down Dupont Circle. So, you know it gets lit like around the nighttime. So, I'm on the grill and shoutout to my boy Frampton he's up in New York right now, my man Ream, and he was like, there was this really heavy-set woman, and she had a bald head but she looked like Amber Rose and so he was just like, he was just joking and the Migos had kinda just got hot, and so he just was like he was like, “Amber Rose, Amber Rose, she look like she, Amberrrr!” and I'm like “Ay bro that’s dope as shit” and he kind of like rapped a little bit, but he didn't want to tell anybody. So, I was like “let me just use that” he's like “go ahead, I don't care.” I got drunk, went to the studio, and did the hook and it just went crazy.  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

You know what I'm saying, ‘Amber Rose’ on ‘Mr. Rogers’, so I just take inspiration from other people too and I don't mind saying I got it from you, I ain't gonna do you dirty, you what I'm saying? 
                    <br/>
                     <br/>
<b>AGS: That's some real-life application right there. </b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Yeah, you know what I'm saying like right, if I could sign you up so I can put your name on it, I would to you feel me like, say whatever goes right, I don't give a fuck like. 
 <br/>
<br/>
                    <b>AGS: As long as it goes hard, as long as it goes hard.</b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
It’s about being creative, about creativity, like real creativity. And now I think you what know I'm saying people miss that in the game now, that creativity part. It's all about, you know, I like, I used to think that way, just make a hit! And now I'm just like man just live and just then just let it go, you know what I'm saying like live, let it go. I don't think, I didn't go to the studio like all of 2019. I'll skip the studio for a year 'cause I record so much and I'm like I just want to live life so I can just sit back, live, go on vacation. So I can then write about stuff or think about stuff 'cause you know, I just feel like this life, people just be just trying to rush through it and that's why you don't make a good product or just sound like everybody else like you gotta live a little bit. And to rappers man, live a little like it's OK like, it’s how your music can grow and expand you know what I'm saying. So, living a little definitely helps me make my music.

                    <br/>
                    <b>SC: So you know you've had a relatively long career so far. There have been a lot of moments throughout all this music making, a lot of ups, a lot of downs, a lot of people you met, a lot of people you hoped you could’ve met, but what's been your favorite part of your entire musical career so far? Was there ever a moment in your entire career where it was like, yes, this is it. This is me. </b>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Was two moments. The first moment I was in the car with my pops, and I got the Pap Brady name from him. People call him Pap. They called my little brother and my big brother Lil Pap. So you know what I’m saying I got the inspiration from them, you know what I’m saying. Number one like even my brand Lean Proof Entertainment, my brother made that, free my big bro you feeling me. Like he made me, he was the one who put everything in my everything, like what am I gonna do to really help the family and push our family name out, you know what I'm saying? And God's name but just really get our name out here somehow, and he told me that when I was 13. So, my dad, he doesn't really know what's going on, but he knows you feel me. So, I realize I think I got the ‘Nit Wit Get Wit’, my song ‘Nit Wit Get Wit’ where I felt like I was at “now I got it.” I got this shit, this is it, I got it and we're in the car and I don't let him play/listen to my music, I always be really uh, I feel like now my confidence is sky high. I always had high confidence but I just didn't know how to exert it in certain times, like maybe with the girls my confidence is up here, but then my music, I'm being shy, you feel what I'm saying? So, I never really let nobody hear my, I let people hear my music, but I had to think about it. But one day I said man fuck that shit, I'm playing this music. I’m great man! 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
So I played ‘Nit Wit Get Wit’ in the car and we sit there. Song goes off. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
He goes, “this you?” 
<br/>
                    <br/>
I was like, “yeah”  
<br/>
                    <br/>
He was like, “Nah this really good, this really good man, like nah this is really great man” and he talks about that song to this day. 
<br/>
                    <br/>
Now that’s 4-5 years ago, that was the first one. That was one of my favorite moments. The second one was recent. My mom is not on board for none of the music. She tell me straight up, “I know you do music, but I don't even listen to it 'cause of the cussin.” She said she doesn't like me cussing and she really told me this year that she was really proud of me. 'cause she really went to go look at my site (papbrady.com) and my videos and she said my son is really creative and she just thanked God for my creativity. 'cause you know my parents, they were caught up in life and they probably didn't really realize, she probably didn't really realize how talented I really was, and I used to wanna force it on people, but then I just was like I can't. Like it goes back to you know Yahh.Nezz as he said in your first interview, the “PUT YOURSELF ON” saying. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
I was like I gotta just do it. I can't wait for my mother or anybody just to be “OK.” Yeah, it's great, you know what I'm saying? If I really love it, if I really have fun with this, it shouldn't matter. Just do it. And I've been doing that, and it's just been going, it took years. But finally, she was like, “nah, I'm rocking with it, I'm on board” 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
And I think definitely the clothing line too definitely had her like OK, my son is pretty serious about this and it's not for play play, you feel what I'm saying? And I'm not click-riding; dick-riding. I'm not doing some outlandish shit. I don't gotta flash money, I don’t gotta put guns in my video, I don’t gotta do none of that to prove that I'm the best rapper in the world, you feel what I’m saying?  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
You gotta think like that, bruh and it's just like, I'm just, you know, when my mother is starting to realize and I just remember calls from my mom when I wasn't doing things that I was supposed to do and she used to, I remember my mom cried to me about where she was just wondering where my life was gonna go and to now she's like, “I’m just so proud of you.” You feel what I'm saying, so it's just like those are my two favorite accomplishments, man. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
Just watching everybody around me just be inspired by me to keep going. I just want people to keep going like whatever you do, just keep going man and keep God first and allow him to lead your path and I think I just was fighting that for a long time. I was trying to create my own path and I was forcing things and now I just go down God’s path and then I've been doing that and just been working and it's, we're here in 2021 and I have an interview, that's history for me! I didn't never ever haven't gone, how long I've been rapping? I've been, you know, officially Pap Brady since I was in like 2015 and this is my first interview of the year, so I'm just, this moment right here is just special for me. You know what I'm saying with y’all 'cause we're gonna talk about this, God willing, years from now. Be like dang, “I mean we was on that interview and we just we just wrapping it and then said, y'all gonna be at my concert and we're gonna be talking” you feel what I'm saying?  
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
So, you know what I'm saying you just gotta be, I just believe in what I'm doing, and I and I talked to other artists, I tell ‘em the same thing this follow God’s path. Don't try to make your own way man and ‘cause sometimes when you try to make your own way, you trip up a lot, man. And I've tripped up a lot, I'm talking bout opportunities, off camera we could probably talk about millions of opportunities that I’ve had that probably would have set me up to be big artist. But I told you, I wasn't ready for it. You understand, I wasn't I wasn't ready for it. You know what I'm saying. But the favorite moments man, I got so many men. Dropping mixtapes, dropping tapes you know what I'm saying, that. So, you know, the good times, I could go on. You know we'll save that for another time tho, you dig.
