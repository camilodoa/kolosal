      <p>We are so pleased to welcome India-based alternative rock band, KYOJIN, to the Kolosal Interview show! Speaking with members Rahul and Aayush, we got the inside scoop into how their music is made and what inspired the one-of-a-kind stories behind it. Being our first interview with a band, it was great to hear about the group dynamic that comes into play with their music. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has stopped them from both being able to work together and to perform like they usually do. But these guys have SO much talent and even more ideas for how they're gonna make the most of it. Make sure to stream, download, and follow them everywhere (links down below) - their work is incredible and we couldn't be more excited to see where these next few years take them!</p>

      <p>KAE DRACO is in the house!!!! Repping the DMV and it's signature "crank" style, Kae is one of the few putting the district on the map right now. With a sound like no other and a cadence that rides right over the trap beats that she finds herself on, Kae is one of the most exciting up-and-coming artists coming out of the area today. 
        <br/>
          <br/>
We couldn't be more grateful for Kae taking the time out of her day to talk with us about her music and the life story behind it. Touching on everything from her live shows to the definition of the crank sound, this interview gave us an unprecedented view into the life of Kae and the rap scene that's allowed her to share her art. </p>
